# Space Invaders - The Clone Wars

Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game created by [Tomohiro Nishikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomohiro_Nishikado). This is a modern take on that original game with it's own unique spin. As you progress the invaders get to fire more shorts and their shots speed up to a max speed. At the same time your rewards for destroying an enemy ship goes up every level you survive.
